# The Linux Notes Repository

Notes for Linux.

## Commands

The [commands](commands) directory contains list of markdown files for each command. Note that the primary goal of the command cheat sheets is intended for unusual cases but not limited to basic usage.

## How-Tos

The [how-to](how-to) directory contains list of how-to articiles, aiming to be short and precise references for chosen specific use case rather than full blown explanation.
