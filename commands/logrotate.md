### Create a logrotate configuration.

There should be a number of existing logrotate configuration files located under `/etc/logrotate.d` directory to be used as an example.
If there is nothing to grab, here is a sample:

```
/var/log/vault/vault.log {
        rotate 7
        daily
        compress
        delaycompress
        missingok
        notifempty
        copytruncate
        postrotate
                /usr/bin/kill -HUP `pidof vault` >> /var/log/vault/vault-error.log 2>&1 || true
        create 660 vault vault 
}
```


|Option| Description|
|------|------------|
|daily |	Log files are rotated every day.|
|weekly|	Log files are rotated if the current weekday is less than the weekday of the last rotation or if more than a week has passed since the last rotation. This is normally the same as rotating logs on the first day of the week, but if logrotate is not being run every night a log rotation will happen at the first valid opportunity.|
|monthly|	Log files are rotated the first time logrotate is run in a month (this is normally on the first day of the month).|
|notifempty|	Do not rotate the log if it is empty (this overrides the ifempty option).|
|nocompress|	Old versions of log files are not compressed.|
|delaycompress|	Postpone compression of the previous log file to the next rotation cycle. This only has effect when used in combination with compress. It can be used when some program cannot be told to close its logfile and thus might continue writing to the previous log file for some time.|
|compress|	Old versions of log files are compressed with gzip by default.|
|mail address|	When a log is rotated out of existence, it is mailed to address. If no mail should be generated by a particular log, the nomail directive may be used.|
|missingok|	If the log file is missing, go on to the next one without issuing an error message.|
|copytruncate|  The copytruncate option allows storing rotated log files on the different devices using `olddir` directive. The `copytruncate` option implies `norenamecopy`.|
|postrotate|  Command to be executed post logrotate operation. Some application requires notification to manage the log file handler. The `copytruncate` option may be used to achieve the same goal.|
